# Crowdfunding_ETL

Created an ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas to transform crowdfunding data into CSV files (campaign, category, subcategory, and contacts). 
Organized files in a GitHub repository. 
Created an ERD and table schema, then load data into a PostgreSQL database named crowdfunding_db.
